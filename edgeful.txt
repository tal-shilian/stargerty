the ORB algo: everything you need to know
let’s first talk about the ORB algo — what it is, what setup we’re trading,
and the performance we’ve seen from the algo in 2025.
what is the ORB?
the opening range breakout (ORB) algo uses the first 15 minutes of
trading to identify key levels. here are the two levels the algo is
identifying for you:
the opening range high (high made in the first 15min of trading)
the opening range low (low made in the first 15min of trading)
when price breaks above or below this range, the algo is looking to
take a trade.
the exact setup:
the ORB algo is simple — we’re taking a breakout trade on a close above
the 15min ORB high, or we’re taking a breakdown trade on a close below
the 15min ORB low.
this is a continuation setup — meaning we’re looking for price to continue
in the direction of the breakout or breakdown (either up — breakout, or
down — breakdown).
the algo is only entering on a close above/below these key levels.
profit targets & stop losses:
on the custom TradingView ORB algo strategy itself — you’re able to set
custom profit target and stop loss levels, both of which you can optimize
using our ORB reports.
you’ll get a more in-depth look at exactly how to do that once you sign
up (we’ve got a ton of educational videos walking you through), but
here’s what it’ll look like on TradingView once you get access:
performance (2025 year-to-date)
let’s now look at the performance of the ORB algo this year — from
January 1st, 2025 to October 17th, 2025:
trading 1 NQ contract on a $10,000 account:
total profit: $32,000 (+320% return)
win rate: 76%
max drawdown: 18%
total trades: 89
profit factor: 2.6
takes one trade per day max
this is all of 2025. one NQ contract. starting with $10,000.
to be clear — these are not the default settings.
but I walk you through exactly how to optimize your algos — what days
to trade long/short, what days to sit out completely, how to optimize
your profit targets/stop losses — in our education section of the algos
dashboard:
what this means for you
if you
'
re trading a completely random strategy — it’s very likely you’ve
been chopped to pieces this year. and honestly, this has been one of the
biggest pain points we’re trying to solve for you with the algos.
consistent entries
consistent exits
clear rules
the ORB is the most consistent algo we offer. if you struggle with
emotions — holding winners too long, cutting profits early, moving stops,
sizing too aggressively — this is the solution.
no more sabotaging your trades.
no more FOMO or greed.
just simplified execution done for you (once you optimize them to fit
your style).
the gap fill algo: everything you need to know
let'
s now talk about the gap fill algo — what it is, what setup we
'
trading, and the performance we
'
ve seen from the algo in 2025.
re
what is a gap fill?
the gap fill algo identifies when price opens above or below yesterday
'
s
close, creating a
"
gap.
" the market often fills these gaps during the
session, and we trade toward the previous session close (PSC).
here
'
s what the algo is identifying for you:
yesterday
'
s close (the level we
'
re targeting)
today
'
s open (where the gap starts)
the gap direction (up or down)
when there
'
s a gap, the algo is looking to enter toward the previous
session close.
the exact setup:
the gap fill algo is simple — when price opens above or below
yesterday
'
s close, we
'
re trading toward that previous session close.
'
gap up: we
re looking to short back down to yesterday
'
s close
gap down: we
'
re looking to long back up to yesterday
'
s close
this is a mean reversion setup — meaning we
'
re looking for price to fill
the gap and return to the previous session close.
profit targets & stop losses:
on the custom TradingView gap fill algo strategy itself — you
'
re able to
set custom profit target and stop loss levels, both of which you can
optimize using our gap fill reports.

performance (2025 year-to-date)
let'
s now look at the performance of the gap fill algo this year — from
January 1st, 2025 to October 21st, 2025:
trading 1 NQ contract on a $10,000 account:
total profit: $36,285 (+362% return)
win rate: 45%
profit factor: 1.9
max drawdown: ~22%
total trades: 113
takes one trade per day max
this is all of 2025.
to be clear — these are not the default settings.
but I walk you through which reports you can use to optimize your
algos — what days to trade (Tuesday’s have the highest fill
percentage on NQ as on November 2025), what days to sit out
completely (Monday’s and Friday’s aren’t great on NQ as of
November 2025), how to optimize your profit targets/stop losses — in
our education section of the algos dashboard:
what this means for you
here
'
s what you need to understand about the gap fill — you
'
re going
to lose more often than you win.
45% win rate means 55% of your trades are losers.
but when you win, you win big — often 3-5x bigger than your losses.
check out this performance table to see what I mean:
look at the trade list: +$2,000, +$3,000... then -$300,
-$600.
those losses are nothing compared to the winners.
this is the opposite of the ORB algo. ORB has 76% win rate with
smaller winners. gap fill has 45% win rate with much bigger winners.
most traders can
't handle this. they take 3 losses in a row and quit
right before the big winner.
if you want consistent small wins, trade ORB. if you can handle more
losses but want bigger payouts, trade gap fill.
the engulfing candles algo: everything you need to know
let'
s now talk about the engulfing candles algo — what it is, what setup
'
we
re trading, and the performance we
'
ve seen from the algo in 2025.
what is an engulfing candle?
the engulfing candles algo identifies when a candle fully covers
(engulfs) the previous candle. this signals potential reversal or
continuation, but most traders take every engulfing candle pattern and
wonder why they lose money.
we only take the high-probability setups.
here
'
s what the algo is identifying for you:
bullish engulfing: green candle fully covers previous red candle
(potential reversal up)
bearish engulfing: red candle fully covers previous green candle
(potential reversal down)
when an engulfing pattern forms, the algo is looking to take a trade.
the exact setup:
the engulfing candles algo scans for engulfing patterns on 30-minute
charts throughout the trading session.
this is different from ORB, IB, and gap fill — those all take one trade per
day max. the engulfing algo can take multiple
trades in a single session.
profit targets & stop losses:
as I’m sure you can see now, all of our algos have the ability to be fully
customized, and the engulfing candles algo is no different:
you can customize:
your max loss
your take profit levels
your stop loss levels
your min & max engulfing bar sizes
the days you want the algo to trade
the direction you want the algo to trade
our goal is to give you every input possible to build a winning strategy —
built on data.
performance (2025 year-to-date)
let'
s now look at the performance of the engulfing algo this year — from
January 1st, 2025 to August 19th, 2025:
trading 1 ES contract on a $10,000 account:
total profit: $20,973 (+210% return)
win rate: 69%
profit factor: 1.481
max drawdown: 28%
total trades: 215
takes multiple trades per day (5-6 max per session)
to be clear — these are not the default settings.
but I walk you through exactly how to optimize your algos using excel in
our education section of the algos dashboard.
what this means for you
here
'
s what makes the engulfing candles algo different — it performs
really well on days when most traders get chopped to pieces.
and because it takes multiple trades per day, you
'
re not sitting around
waiting for one setup. the algo is actively trading throughout the
session when conditions are right.
no more getting stopped out repeatedly on range-bound sessions.
just multiple high-probability setups executed consistently (once you
optimize them to fit your style).
the IB algo: everything you need to know
let'
s now talk about the IB algo — what it is, what setup we
'
re trading,
and the performance we
'
ve seen from the algo in 2025.
what is the IB?
the initial balance (IB) algo uses the first hour of trading to identify key
levels. here are the two levels the algo is identifying for you:
the initial balance high (high made in the first hour of trading —
9:30am to 10:30am ET)
the initial balance low (low made in the first hour of trading —
9:30am to 10:30am ET)
when price breaks above or below this range, the algo is looking to take
a trade.
the exact setup:
the IB algo waits for the full hour to form (until 10:30am ET), then looks
for a breakout above the IB high or a breakdown below the IB low.
from the breakout or breakdown — we’re looking for a retrace back into
the IB range before getting long/short. this is different from the ORB that
we just covered, and the reason is because of data. let me show you
what I mean…
here are the stats from our IB by retracement report on edgeful.
what we’re analyzing is how often price retraces back into the IB range
after a breakout or a breakdown, and to what levels it retraces. the data
is clear:
the above screenshot is data from ES over the last 6 months
about 75% of the time, price will retrace back into 10% of the IB range
after breaking out.
about 45% of the time, price will retrace back into 25% of the IB range
after breaking out.
about 35% of the time, price will retrace back into 45% of the IB range
after breaking out.
you can then use this report to identify good entry levels as well as stop
loss levels.
for your entry, you want an area that price often touches after breaking
out/breaking down (10% is a good area based on the data above).
for your stop loss, you want an area that price doesn’t often touch after
breaking out/breaking down (>50% makes sense based on the data
above).
customizations on the IB algo in TradingView
on the actual IB algo itself — you have almost limitless ability to customize
your inputs.
you can change your:
entry and exit level colors (so that they’re clearly plotted)
your entry/exit/take profit levels based on day of the week
your min & max initial balance range %
 the point is to give you everything you need to create a strategy that fits
your risk profile and trading style, while also building the foundation on
data.
performance (2025 year-to-date)
let'
s now look at the performance of the IB algo this year — from January
1st, 2025 to October 29th, 2025:
trading 2 ES contracts on a $10,000 account:
total profit: ~$35,000 (+350% return)
win rate: 41%
profit factor: 2.1
max drawdown: 25.5%
total trades: 147
takes one trade per day max
when analyzing the above graph — it should be easy to see that the IB
algo had a great run up until July of 2025. since then, it has gone
sideways.
this is normal for various strategies in the market — working, then the
environment shifts, and then they fall out of favor for the time being. this is
okay and completely normal.
so what should you do in a situation like this?
1.track the performance of the algo on a daily or weekly basis
2.you must understand the win rate of the strategy — and then analyze
what normal losing/winning streak periods look like (refer to the
consecutive wins/losses graphic at the end of this PDF)
3.you can either turn off the strategy completely, and wait for the algo to
reach a new high on the performance chart before starting it again, or
size down completely and only trade micros until it performs better
this is the beauty of trading — no single strategy is going to make you a
millionaire overnight, but when you combine different strategies and build
confidence in them using data, you’re able to navigate any market
environment.
the next step: fully automating your algos
when you get access to the algos — they’re not fully automated yet.
you’ll get entry/exit alerts, but automating them takes a couple of extra
steps.
we’ve outlined exactly what you need to do on the algos dashboard,
and have videos + step by step instructions. you’ll find those here:
why you should automate your algos
even if you can sit at your screen all day, can you trust yourself to follow
the strategy?
no hesitating. no adding to losers. no moving stops. no cutting profits
early.
the automation does exactly what the data says. nothing more, nothing
less.
and if you
'
re at work, in a meeting, driving, or busy during market hours?
the automation handles everything.
important: don
't skip this part
before you automate anything:
1.watch all education videos (required) — 13 videos total, most are just
a few minutes
2.paper trade for at least one week
3.understand what each algo is doing
4.start with small size
automation only works if you understand what'
s being automated. don
't
rush this.
 getting started
1.upgrade to algos at edgeful.com/algos
2.complete education videos
3.join the private discord for algo users (settings shared there)
4.paper trade for one week minimum
5.go live when you
